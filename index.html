	<h1>My Work History</h1>
	<br>
	<p>My name is <b>Max Miguta</b> and I have built this website to inform any potential employers or clients of my <b>key skills</b> and competencies as well as my <b>work history</b> and thus to act as an extension of my CV. In order to stay relevant the employment history does not go back more than about 10 years.</p>

	<h2><a id="work1">Scotia UK plc</a></h2>
	<p>It has been a long road from when I first arrived at Scotia UK as a graduate to where I am today in terms of the wealth of design and business knowledge and experience. Although a great deal of my focus has been on the creative side of delivering marketing solutions, over the years spent at the company I had the opportunity to gain invaluable knowledge of the structure and management of a business. Therefore I believe my business acumen and analytical skills add real value to my design abilities.</p>

			<h4>Marketing Assistant</h4>
			<p>I arrived at the company as a graduate via the Modern Apprenticeship in Business & Administration scheme and started out in the marketing department. My first role was essentially in graphic design and desktop publishing.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I initially learned the InDesign and Photoshop graphics packages on the job and also took Adobe certified courses to gain advanced proficiency</li>
				<li>I helped design various printed marketing collateral such as posters, leaflets, brochures, as well as providing designs for business cards and company stationery</li>
				<li>I also dealt with our professional printing supplier in terms of organising print runs for the marketing material we produced</li>
				<li>I liaised with the sales team to help with physical mass mailing (in the days of mail merge) of our marketing material to the client base</li>
				<li>I was involved in company exhibitions – from designing printed content to helping organise the events and being on site on the day to help with setting up stands and answering visitors' queries</li>
				<li>Then for the first time I got involved with the company's website that was initially managed by an external IT company – I assisted with new ideas for both the written and graphical content to freshen up the site</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Web Designer</h4>
			<p>Once Scotia UK introduced Microsoft CRM database management system the company could finally start mailing out its marketing material electronically to its vast customer base much more efficiently. At this point my focus moved a lot more to digital publishing.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I learned the CRM system and the sales process that it helped to facilitate – this was crucial to the sales effort as a whole since not only did it allow the marketing department to support the needs of the sales team but crucially it also integrated the accounts and logistics divisions</li>
				<li>I carried out mass mailing to client database on behalf of the sales team through the CRM system – from design and upload of promotional content online through to CRM campaign setup and testing and finally to delivery of mailshots</li>
				<li>In terms of sales support I also got more involved in creation of digital content for the likes of Power Point and Digital Signage layouts, which were used for sales demos and presentations</li>
				<li>At that point I also learned the functionality of the company Intranet (the early version of SharePoint) which used SharePoint Designer 2007 as an editor</li>
				<li>I was tasked with completely redesigning the Scotia UK website as the company looked to refresh its image – at that point our site passed from external management to fully in-house</li>
				<li>I then had the responsibility of keeping the website updated with any new additions or changes in the company's AV product line and services</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Executive Assistant</h4>
			<p>After five or six years I took on a more prominent role in the company as I started assisting my line manager on key matters as she advanced from Marketing Manager to Managing Director. This meant she had less time to run the marketing department, which gave me an opportunity to be more directly involved in some of the more important decision making and to work more under my own direction.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I completed Adobe Dreamweaver advanced course to give me complete control over all the major design capabilities of the website editor and in turn give me confidence in creating a highly functional website virtually unassisted</li>
				<li>As my skills in design got better and the company sought to improve its visibility and online presence, I was tasked with redesigning the Scotia UK website for a second time, so it would take on a fresher look and deliver a better user experience</li>
				<li>Shortly after I was given an opportunity to build a brand new website for Scotia UK's smaller sister company called SMOTS – links to both can be found on my Skills page</li>
				<li>I also helped the company gain exposure through the social media by setting up a corporate Facebook page for the main website, keeping it updated, and also setting up a Twitter feed on the SMOTS site, as it already had an active account</li>
				<li>Additionally I started applying Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) to the Scotia UK website to give it higher visibility by increasing its ranking on the major search engines; and also obtained monthly Google Analytics reports for visits to the site and its various pages to determine effectiveness of certain content</li>
				<li>I took on the job of optimising the design of the company Intranet as well as maintaining it since a lot of operational and administrative processes had to be recorded on a centralised web based front end and important information and documents had to be made easily accessible to staff from all departments</li>

			<h4>Health & Safety Coordinator</h4>
			<p>In the last two years I moved away from the daily maintenance of the company websites and to further broaden my horizons I took charge of the health and safety processes at Scotia UK. The majority of the company's revenue comes from Audio Visual sales and thus it is heavily dependent on the success of AV equipment installation on client sites all over the country. This makes continual existence and enforcement of safety measures and processes of paramount importance to the business.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I ensured Risk Assessments were regularly carried out for any activities presenting even the slightest risk – this involved preparing risk assessment documents for AV installations carried out on external sites</li>
				<li>I liaised with appointed professional H&S advisors to ensure continual compliance with and improvement of safety standards at the company</li>
				<li>I trained new and existing personnel in the basics of health and safety and/or new important safety legislation in the industry – this was also part of HR induction for new employees</li>
				<li>I kept the company fully compliant in health and safety standards and practices, which involved completing annual CHAS assessments, completing sub-contractor H&S questionnaires for various clients to allow our engineers to work on external sites and organised essential safety training for the engineers</li>
				<li>I took responsibility for provision of safety equipment and clothing to our Installation team and also its maintenance; ordered equipment from suppliers and also negotiated for a better deal with a new supplier</li>
				<li>After the company switched to the newest version of Microsoft CRM, set up Office 365 and with it the latest version of SharePoint (2013) I liaised with our IT consultants to customise the SharePoint front end for each of the departments, like it was done with the old version, and to improve overall user experience</li>

	<h2><a id="work2">Mapix Technologies</a></h2>
	<p>In the beginning of 2017 I held a temporary position at Mapix, a company that is in many ways similar to Scotia UK, so I found it easy to integrate. Mapix is a small company specialising in geospatial engineering and is a distributor for a number of third party LIDAR products (allowing for 3D mapping) designed for use on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).</p>
	<p>My main role was <b>Sales Administrator</b> and I had the following duties:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Providing the first line of support for all initial sales enquiries, primarily via email, and passing on information to appropriate sales colleagues when necessary</li>
		<li>Entry of new leads, contacts and suppliers into the CRM database and continual updating of the system throughout the various stages of sales process</li>
		<li>Creation of quotes for new and existing customers, preparing items for shipment to customers and other general administrative tasks</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a id="work3">Capita plc</a></h2>
	<p>In the middle of 2017 I joined an Insurance Services division at Capita on a three month contract. The company is a large provider of business process outsourcing in the UK. During my time there I was part of a project team working on a specific case for a client - a large insurance company.</p>
	<p>My position was <b>Data Gatherer</b> and it involved preparing case files with complete and relevant information for thousands of customers serviced by Capita's client. The insurance company granted access to specific in-house databases containing all their customer records and the team had to retrieve certain information for selected customers and record it on spreadsheets.</p>
